It's both the fastest production Mustang ever built and the most powerful street legal Ford product ever. By all accounts, this Shelby pushes the current generation Mustang and Ford's modular V8 to their absolute limits.</p>

                    The Ford Shelby GT500 was produced both by Shelby and by Ford and has become one of the most widely recognised Mustangs of all time. Eleanor as we like to call her - after the classic Shelby Mustang featured in the movie Gone in 60 Seconds - has a thumping V8 engine that produces a sound like a jet fighter and looks that are breathtaking.

                    If you think the regular Ford Mustang is a work of art, then the Shelby Mustang GT500 is a masterpiece – a higher performance variant with all of the cool looks of the original. This Shelby is a tribute to a famous film car by the name of ‘Eleanor’, so if you imagine yourself as something of a race car film star (with a hint of Nicholas Cage-iness) then this is the perfect experience for you.
